# Two Sum Problem

This problem is mainly about finding index of two numbers in an array that add up to a target number. The description to the problem is [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description).

## Solution
There are many approaches to solving this problem, but I use the simplest way, brute forcing, to find the correct pair. Of course this is not a ideal method, because it has the time complexity `O(n^2)`.
