# Learning Progress

This repository is devoted to chronicling my journey in acquiring coding skills and proficiency in specific frameworks. My primary focus lies in web development, with a strong emphasis on backend technologies such as PHP, Java, and C#, and frontend tools including React.js and Vue.js. Additionally, I am diligently exploring Software-Pattern implementations primarily using Java, with relevant code available at [here](https://github.com/vinstonsalim/learning/tree/main/JAVA).

In order to deepen my comprehension of Data Structures and Algorithms, I regularly engage in LeetCode problem-solving, with my solutions accessible [here](https://github.com/vinstonsalim/learning/tree/main/JAVA/Leetcode).
