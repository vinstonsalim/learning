# Learning Progress

This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey to acquire programming skills and knowledge in specific frameworks. My main focus is on web development, with a strong focus on backend technologies such as PHP, Java and C# and front-end tools such as React.js and Vue.js. I'm also actively studying design patterns, most of which are implemented in Java. The corresponding code is available at [here](https://github.com/vinstonsalim/learning/tree/main/JAVA/Design-Patterns).

In order to deepen my comprehension of Data Structures and Algorithms, I regularly engage in LeetCode problem-solving, with my solutions accessible [here](https://github.com/vinstonsalim/learning/tree/main/JAVA/Leetcode).

## [PHP](https://github.com/vinstonsalim/learning/tree/main/PHP/)
